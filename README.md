# NYC Data Engineering | Modern Data Engineering GCP Project

## Introduction 

The objective of this project is to perform data analytics on NYC Taxi Trip Record Data using various tools and technologies, including Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services such as Storage, Compute Engine, BigQuery, and Looker Studio. The project also utilizes the Mage Data Pipeline Tool for modern data engineering processes.

## Architecture

Technology Used

    Programming Language: Python

## Google Cloud Platform

- Google Storage: Used for storing the Uber data and intermediate results.
- Compute Instance: Provides a virtual machine environment to run data processing tasks and Python scripts.
- BigQuery: A fully-managed data warehouse service used for storing and querying large datasets.
- Looker Studio: A data exploration and visualization platform for analyzing data stored in BigQuery.

## Modern Data Pipeline Tool

The Mage Data Pipeline Tool is used for efficient and scalable data integration and processing. It helps in building and orchestrating data pipelines for ingesting, transforming, and loading data from various sources into the desired destination.

## Dataset Used

The project utilizes the TLC Trip Record Data, which includes yellow taxi trip records. The dataset contains fields capturing information such as pick-up and drop-off dates/times, locations, trip distances, fares, rate types, payment types, and passenger counts reported by the drivers.
